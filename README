BdAutoBackup

Author: Alex Sullivan

This script is used to create a cron job to back up Black Duck's containerized Postgres instance daily. This only works with Docker
It will create a bd-backups directory in your home directory to store the dumps. This will be overwritten with each run of the job.
It grabs and runs the latest version of the "hub_create_data_dump.sh" script from the Black Duck github.
Paths and cron schedule can be modified via variables instead of modifying the script directly.

scriptPath sets where bddailybackup.sh will live. This is the script the cron job runs.
backupDir sets where it saves your Black Duck database
cronSched sets the frequency that the script will run. By default it will run daily at midnight. You can  visit https://crontab.guru/ for help determining the correct pattern for your cron job to run.

Please run the installbddailybackup.sh script as a Docker enabled user to ensure that it has necessary permissions when the job runs.
